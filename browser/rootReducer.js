// Now you're ready to go, and the rest is up to you! Define the action types, action creators and sub-reducers that your redux app will use to calculate the state. Use the connect function from react-redux to obtain slices of state and the dispatch method throughout your app.


const rootReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  return state;

};

export default rootReducer;
